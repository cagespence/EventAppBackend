# Assignment 4 Backend

This is the backend for our Event app - an application that allows users to find events based on their interests.

## Spring Boot (kotlin) with MySQL and GraphQL

We use GraphQL instead of a rest service

### Installation
Clone the repo and run `mvn install` in the root directory

### Running the server

Enter `mvn spring-boot:run` and your server will be available on http://localhost:8080

To access [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql), navigate to http://localhost:8080/graphiql to test the backend
